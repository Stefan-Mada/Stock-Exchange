Documentation
=============

Documentation is generated with Doxygen. Here are some pages to quickly check out.
If you are on GitHub, the links below will not appear. Instead, you will need to download the repo, build the
documentation, then open `docs/html/index.html` to have the interactive documentation.

You can build the documentation following the same steps as build the program normally, but then running:

    cmake --build . --target=docs

In your build directory.
